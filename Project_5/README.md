# Project 5: Decentralized Star Notary

use your blockchain identity to secure digital assets on the Ethereum platform using a smart contract


[Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2297/view)


Smart contract implements all these functions - createStar(), putStarUpForSale(), buyStar(), checkIfStarExist(), mint(), approve(), safeTransferFrom(), SetApprovalForAll(), getApproved(), isApprovedForAll(), ownerOf(), starsForSale(), tokenIdToStarInfo()


## Why this project

The project emphasizes on the integration of the Ethereum blockchain platform. Functionality will demonstrate smart contract as a service. You can publicly reveal the digest to prove you had the data that generates the digest. Furthermore, the service will provide digital asset timestamping and integrity validation.<br>

You will interact with your notary web service using a web client configured with Metamask to post new star to the blockchain that will contain metadata payload options. Once a new star is created, a transaction occurs that assists in the proof of asset ownership.

## What will I learn?

This project will allow you to build and expand upon the concepts and skills youâ€™ve gained throughout this course. With this project you will:<br>

- Write a smart contract with functions that support of proof of existence (also known as notarization)
- Test smart contract code coverage
- Deploy smart contract on a public test networks (e.g. Rinkeby)
- Utilize javascript to modify client side code to interact with a smart contract
- Understand the difference between fungible and non-fungible tokens
- Understand the difference between ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards
